# Agentic-Memory

Welcome to the **Agentic Memory Guide** by Cheshire Terminal, a practical blueprint for creating an AI system that transcends the stateless limitations of traditional language models. Drawing from human memory frameworks and the innovative **Wonderland Memory System**, this guide equips you with the tools to build an AI—think of it as your own Mad Hatter—that remembers past interactions, learns from experiences, and adapts to user needs. By leveraging **LangChain**, vector databases, and blockchain integrations with **Bitcoin**, **Solana**, and **Base**, we’ll craft an agentic AI that thrives in open-ended environments like Wonderland.

The current date is **March 10, 2025**, and this guide reflects the latest advancements in AI memory frameworks. Let’s dive down the rabbit hole!
